## Project description:

## Preprocess data:

- Explore data, check for missing data and apply data scaling. Justify the type of scaling used.

## Regression Task:
- Applied all the regression models. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best scaling parameter. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results.
- Used cross validation to find average training and testing score.
## Regression models: 

- KNN repressor

- linear regression

- Ridge

 - Lasso

- polynomial regression

- SVM both simple and with kernels.

### Best regressor model for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict buzz for the test_set.

### Classification task:

Decided about a good evaluation strategy and justify your choice.

## Find best parameters for following classification models:

- KNN classifcation

- Logistic Regression

- Linear Supprt Vector Machine

- Kerenilzed 

- Support Vector Machine

- Decision Tree.

## Which model gives the best results?
